// Exercise 1: What happens if you try to reassign a `let` variable?


// Exercise 2: What happens if you divide myInteger with 2?


// Exercise 3: Print out a string that says "Hello, world!"


// Exercise 4: Create an array that includes several countries and print it.


// Exercise 5: Print out the number of items in your array from Exercise 4


// Exercise 6: Use a for-loop to print out "Hello, __!" for each place in your array from Exercise 4


// Exercise 7: Create a function that takes an array of places and returns "Hello, ___!", filling the blank with a random element of the given array.


// To make it fancier, pass two arguments: the array of places and a boolean. The boolean will determine if the the string returned will say "Good Morning, ___" or "Good Evening, __ ".


// Exercise 8:
//Create a struct with a data property. Give it an initial value.

//Initialize an instance of your struct, name it "a"

//Create a variable "b" and make it equal to "a"

//Change the data property of "a"

//What does a and b equal?

//Create a class with a data property. Give it an initial value. It should look almost exactly the same as your struct.

//Initialize an instance of your class, name it "x"

//Create another variable "y" and make it equal to "x"

//Change the data property of "x"

//What does x and y equal?



// Exercise 9: Create a struct `Person` that represents a person. Give it a few properties (i.e. First Name, Last Name, Age, etc). Go crazy.


// Exercise 10: Add some instance methods to your Person struct. Try `func greeting()` to have your person instances say "Hello!". If you gave your Person struct a property for `name` and `age`, try `func happyBirthday()` to print out "Happy Birthday {Person's Name}" and update the person's age. Otherwise, think of other instance methods you'd want your `Person` struct to have.

//Create a dictionary where the keys are countries, and the values are arrays of cities that are in it's corresponding country.
// i.e. key France would have a value of [Paris, Versailles]


//Use a for-loop to print out "Hello, ____!" for each city in each country in the dictionary


//Pretend arrays don't have a randomElement function available. Use Int.random(in:) to print out "Hello, __!" for a random place from your array
