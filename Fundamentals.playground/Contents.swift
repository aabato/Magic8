// Exercise 1: What happens if you try to reassign a `let` variable?


// Exercise 2: What happens if you divide myInteger with 2?


// Exercise 3: Print out a string that says "Hello, world!"


// Exercise 4: Create an array that includes several countries and print it.


// Exercise 5: Print out the number of items in your array from Exercise 4


// Exercise 6: Use a for-loop to print out "Hello, __!" for each place in your array from Exercise 4


// Exercise 7: Create a function that takes an array of places and returns "Hello, ___!", filling the blank with a random element of the given array.


// To make it fancier, pass two arguments: the array of places and a boolean. The boolean will determine if the the string returned will say "Good Morning, ___" or "Good Evening, __ ".

//Create a dictionary where the keys are countries, and the values are arrays of cities that are in it's corresponding country.
// i.e. key France would have a value of [Paris, Versailles]


//Use a for-loop to print out "Hello, ____!" for each city in each country in the dictionary


//Pretend arrays don't have a randomElement function available. Use Int.random(in:) to print out "Hello, __!" for a random place from your array
